# Vitreous-Glory
Here is the alpha of a game project I have been working on for a few months, with ZeldoRetro. 
Vitreous Glory is a “fan game” (I use resources from different games, mainly from A Link To The Past). 
I wouldn't place my game in the Zeldas timeline, because it doesn't belong there. It's more of a "what if the monsters weren't the real monsters?". 
You have the option to play it in French and English. English is a little “badly chewed”, so if you see any errors, do not hesitate to tell me. 
You have around 30-40 minutes of playtime for this alpha. The game is more advanced behind, but it will give you an idea of the atmosphere of the game.
Please let me know if you experience any bugs! It’s an alpha, so it's still normal that things aren't alright 🙂   Thank you !
